# Context, memory, and termination: the concerns to separate, and the capability pattern

- **Type**: theory / reference, **non-decisional**
- **Date**: 2026-07-22, amended 2026-08-15 (fourth concern, and the `observe` blind spot)
- **Author**: Arthur-Olivier Fortin
- **Status**: living reference. Pre-decisional reasoning that **feeds a future memory ADR (V3 horizon)** and complements [ADR-AGENT-0014](../../decisions/ADR-AGENT-0014-configurable-termination-strategy.md) § *To watch*.
- **Related**: [ADR-AGENT-0003](../../decisions/ADR-AGENT-0003-loop-termination-state-machine.md), [ADR-AGENT-0011](../../decisions/ADR-AGENT-0011-budget-and-graceful-landing.md), [ADR-AGENT-0014](../../decisions/ADR-AGENT-0014-configurable-termination-strategy.md); the `context/` framework (`sliding-window` V1, `memory` V3); [ADR-AGENT-0008](../../decisions/ADR-AGENT-0008-token-counting-behind-a-port.md).

## Why this document exists

While deciding termination (ADR-AGENT-0014) we worked out a separation of concerns that reaches **beyond** termination: into how context and memory are structured. That reasoning is worth keeping so the future memory decision **inherits** it instead of re-deriving it. This document is **non-decisional**: it records the framing and the open questions. It does **not** decide the memory architecture: that is deliberately deferred to a V3 ADR (ADR-AGENT-0014 § *To watch*).

## The conflation to untangle

Today the `context/` framework hosts **two** providers behind one port, `ContextStrategy`: `sliding-window` (V1) and `memory` (V3). But "**stay within the token window**" and "**remember across sessions**" are two different jobs. Putting both behind the same port is the root of the confusion that surfaced during the termination discussion.

## Four concerns

| Concern | Nature | Who drives it | Optional? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hold the session thread** (the stock) | state, between requests | the application, or the package on its behalf | **no**: any multi-turn agent needs it |
| **Fit the window** (token budget) | plumbing, every turn | the engine, transparent | **no**: every agent needs it |
| **Long-term memory** (recall/store across turns & sessions) | **capability** | either (see the two faces below) | **yes** |
| **Termination** | stop condition | either (`implicit` / `explicit`) | - |

The second is not the agent's job and is never optional. The third is optional and *can* be the agent's job. The fourth is decided in ADR-AGENT-0014. Conflating the second and third under one port is what made memory feel tangled with termination.

### The first concern was missing from this document until 2026-08-15

The original framing went straight from "fit the window" to "remember across sessions" and skipped what sits between them: **who holds the conversation while the session lasts**. Nothing did. `AgentState.history` is born with a run and discarded with it (ADR-AGENT-0003), and `AgenticLLM` carries no state, so a second request started from a fresh `[system, user]` pair.

**The stock and the filter are not the same thing, and confusing them is a trap this document set.** Retention answers "how much do we keep", counted in messages, and belongs to whoever holds the thread. Window budget answers "how many tokens does this model accept", recomputed every iteration, and belongs to the strategy. Calling the sliding window "session memory" merges the two: it stores nothing, it selects from what it is handed. A conversation of 500 messages against a 4000-token budget keeps 500 and sends 12, with no logic in common beyond one shared rule, never cutting between a tool call and its result.

Settled in [ADR-AGENT-0020](../../decisions/ADR-AGENT-0020-conversation-owns-the-session-history.md): a `Conversation` owns the stock, with storage behind a `ConversationStore` port.

### `observe()` is blind to the user, and that constrains any memory strategy

Found while writing ADR-AGENT-0020, and worth recording here because it shapes what a memory strategy can do. In `step.ts`, `observe` is called with `[assistant]` or `[assistant, ...toolResults]`. **The user's own message never reaches it.** It enters through `history` and is read only by `build()`.

A memory strategy meant to retain "this person prefers X" would therefore never see the sentence where they said it. It could read it from `build(history)`, but `build` produces the outgoing context, it does not learn: doing the learning there means recomputing from the whole history on every iteration, which for a summarizing strategy is one LLM call per turn.

The fix is inside `step.ts` and is part of the ADR-AGENT-0020 work. Whoever writes the V3 memory ADR should assume `observe` sees the full exchange, user turn included.

## Memory has two faces: non-exclusive

- **Transparent ("brain")**: memory *fills the window*: retrieval → context injected. In this face memory **is** a `ContextStrategy`. The agent is unaware it exists.
- **Agentic**: memory is a **capability the agent drives** via tools (`remember` / `recall` / `search`), black-box, behind a `Memory` port. The agent decides when to store or recall. Precedent: **MemGPT / Letta**.

These are **not rivals**. A serious system may have **both**: a sliding window to fit the token budget *and* memory tools for long-term recall, possibly over the same backend. The question is not "which one" but "which faces do we want, and where do they live."

## The shared shape: an opt-in capability

`explicit` termination and agentic memory have the **same shape**:

```
capability = { prompt fragment (teaches the model to use it)
             + tool(s) (finish / remember …)
             + implementation behind a port }
```

- **Upside**: one mechanism (register tool(s) + compose the scaffolding prompt) serves both. "Who owns the `finish` prompt fragment?" and "who owns the `remember` prompt fragment?" are the **same** question.
- **Trap**: do **not** build a generic "capability framework" now. `explicit` termination is instance **#1**; agentic memory would be instance **#2**. Extract the shared abstraction only when the **second instance actually lands** (rule of three): never before. Building it early is exactly the overhead the permanent "no overhead" constraint forbids (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`).

## What this implies for the current design (pointers, not decisions)

- **`sliding-window` stays a transparent `ContextStrategy`**: plumbing, not the agent's job. Not in question.
- **Memory's home is the open question**: keep it as a transparent `ContextStrategy` (retrieval-into-window), OR move it to a `Memory` port surfaced as tools, OR both. → the V3 memory ADR.
- **Termination** (ADR-AGENT-0014): `implicit` default, `explicit` opt-in as an evaluation axis. `explicit` couples to the base prompt; the `ContextStrategy` **contract is untouched**, but termination *and* the ADR-AGENT-0011 landing both **write into the message list**, so they must be coordinated in the loop.

## Open questions: to verify / decide later

A checklist for whoever writes the V3 memory ADR (and finishes the loop):

1. **Intent of "memory as `ContextStrategy`"**: is the current `context/memory` provider meant as *transparent retrieval-into-window* (a legitimate `ContextStrategy`), or is it *agentic memory* mislabeled? Verify against the V1 design spec and with the team before building.
2. **Memory model choice**: transparent vs agentic vs both. Decide **empirically** for NATHAN's use case, the same way termination is decided: make it a harness axis and compare rates, don't decide by opinion.
3. **`Memory` port contract (if agentic)**: which operations? `remember` / `recall` / `search` / `forget`? Black-box tools, implementation-swappable behind the port (hexagonal, like every other port here).
4. **Who owns the scaffolding prompt fragment** (`finish`, `remember`): engine-owned canonical fragment vs author-supplied vs hybrid. Decide **once**, when the capability mechanism is built: it is the same decision for both capabilities.
5. **Capability mechanism**: extract a shared abstraction only when the 2nd instance (memory-as-tools) actually lands (rule of three). Until then, wire each capability minimally and inline.
6. **Termination × cost, to verify empirically**: `explicit` re-sends the `finish` tool schema every iteration + a permanent prompt fragment ⇒ a per-call token cost. It only wins if it saves **more wasted iterations than it costs**. Verify per model via the harness.
7. **Landing coordination**: the ADR-AGENT-0011 forced landing drops **all** tools (including `finish`, and any future `remember`). Verify the loop coordinates termination detection + budget landing + the active tool set coherently.
8. **`stopReason` granularity**: does `explicit` termination need a distinguishable `stopReason` for observability, or does `"completed"` suffice? Deferred (ADR-AGENT-0014).

## Verification status

This is **design reasoning**, not a set of provider facts, so it carries no external `stop_reason`-style claims to verify. The one external reference is MemGPT / Letta as the precedent for **agentic, tool-driven memory**; cite their current docs if the V3 ADR leans on them. `[À COMPLÉTER]`: exact MemGPT/Letta citations when the V3 ADR is written.
