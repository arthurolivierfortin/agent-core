/**
 * Run one tool call and turn it into the answer that goes back to the model.
 *
 * **This never throws.** Every failure becomes a `ToolResult` carrying `isError: true`, because
 * a bad tool must not end the run: the model reads the error and can correct itself, where an
 * exception would bring the loop down (safety rule, CLAUDE.md). Three failures are covered here:
 * a tool the agent does not carry, a tool that throws despite its contract, and one that rejects.
 *
 * The design calls for a chain, `record -> [authorize] -> execute` (ADR-AGENT-0004). Only
 * `execute` exists in V1; the other two will be decorators wrapping this call, never branches
 * added inside it.
