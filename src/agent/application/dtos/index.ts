 * Why a run ended.

 * - `budget`: a bound fell, so the agent was asked to conclude (ADR-AGENT-0011).
 * - `stuck`: the same call repeated, so it was asked to conclude, earlier than the budget would.
 * - `error`: **nothing produces it today, deliberately.** A provider failure propagates as an
 *   `LLMError` rather than turning into a result (safety rule, CLAUDE.md), and a failing tool
 *   comes back as a `ToolResult` the model can read. The value is what a state carries if it is
 *   ever read as a result with no reason recorded, which would be a bug in the loop.
