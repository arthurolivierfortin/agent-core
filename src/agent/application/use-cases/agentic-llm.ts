 * `agent.` offers `run`, `step` and `initialState` to autocompletion, where a function returned
 * by a factory offers nothing (ADR-AGENT-0009). The mechanics stay pure functions; this is the
 * handle a consumer holds.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const agent = new AgenticLLM({ agent: navigateur, llm, context });
 * const result = await agent.run("amene-moi aux reglages");

   * precisely so a bound exists even when a consumer configures nothing, and a bound configured
   * with a non-finite number falls back to that default rather than disabling itself.
   *
   * Each run starts from a fresh state, so two runs on the same instance share the wiring and
